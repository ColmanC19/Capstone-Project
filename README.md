# _Capstone Project for Epicodus Bootcamp_

#### By _Colman Currie 3/12/20_

#### _This app is a restaurant guide for the "diamonds in the rough" in Portland._
```
Users can view a list of articles which include: best food carts, most underrated restaurants and where to go if you don't have a reservation. There is also a list of archived articles about Korean food in Portland and tipping etiquette. There is also a "heat map" users can click on to show the hottest not-widely-known restaurants in town. Users will also be able to sign in/sign up.
```
#### _Stretch Goals_
```
I will continue working on this project and here are the goals I would like to reach by the time I show it off at demo day:
1) All articles are fully written/styled
2) Users can sign in to comment on articles
3) Deployed to Heroku
```
